10,10,"Towards the end of November, during a thaw, at nine o’clock one",0.0
11,11,"morning, a train on the Warsaw and Petersburg railway was approaching",-0.0258
12,12,the latter city at full speed.,0.0
13,13,The morning was so damp and misty that,0.0
14,14,it was only with great difficulty that the day succeeded in breaking;,0.6705
15,15,and it was impossible to distinguish anything more than a few yards,0.0
16,16,away from the carriage windows.,0.0
17,17,Some of the passengers by this particular train were returning from,0.0
18,18,"abroad; but the third-class carriages were the best filled, chiefly",0.7783
19,19,"with insignificant persons of various occupations and degrees, picked",-0.34
20,20,up at the different stations nearer town.,0.0
21,21,"All of them seemed weary, and",-0.2732
22,22,"most of them had sleepy eyes and a shivering expression, while their",0.0
23,23,complexions generally appeared to have taken on the colour of the fog,0.0
24,24,outside.,0.0
25,25,"When day dawned, two passengers in one of the third-class carriages",0.0
26,26,found themselves opposite each other.,0.0
27,27,"Both were young fellows, both",0.0
28,28,"were rather poorly dressed, both had remarkable faces, and both were",0.5574
29,29,evidently anxious to start a conversation.,-0.25
30,30,"If they had but known why,",0.0
31,31,"at this particular moment, they were both remarkable persons, they",0.5574
32,32,would undoubtedly have wondered at the strange chance which had set,0.0516
33,33,them down opposite to one another in a third-class carriage of the,0.0
34,34,Warsaw Railway Company.,-0.0258
35,35,"One of them was a young fellow of about twenty-seven, not tall, with",0.0
36,36,"black curling hair, and small, grey, fiery eyes.",-0.296
37,37,His nose was broad and,0.0
38,38,"flat, and he had high cheek bones; his thin lips were constantly",0.0
39,39,"compressed into an impudent, ironical—it might almost be called a",0.0
40,40,"malicious—smile; but his forehead was high and well formed, and atoned",0.3919
41,41,for a good deal of the ugliness of the lower part of his face.,-0.4588
42,42,A,0.0
43,43,"special feature of this physiognomy was its death-like pallor, which",0.4019
44,44,gave to the whole man an indescribably emaciated appearance in spite of,-0.5267
45,45,"his hard look, and at the same time a sort of passionate and suffering",-0.101
46,46,"expression which did not harmonize with his impudent, sarcastic smile",-0.1921
47,47,"and keen, self-satisfied bearing.",0.3612
48,48,He wore a large fur—or rather,0.0
49,49,"astrachan—overcoat, which had kept him warm all night, while his",0.2263

51,51,November night entirely unprepared.,0.0
52,52,His wide sleeveless mantle with a,0.0
53,53,large cape to it—the sort of cloak one sees upon travellers during the,0.0

55,55,"the long cold journey through Russia, from Eydkuhnen to St. Petersburg.",0.0
56,56,"The wearer of this cloak was a young fellow, also of about twenty-six",0.0
57,57,"or twenty-seven years of age, slightly above the middle height, very",0.0
58,58,"fair, with a thin, pointed and very light coloured beard; his eyes were",0.3182
59,59,"large and blue, and had an intent look about them, yet that heavy",0.0
60,60,expression which some people affirm to be a peculiarity as well as,0.4019
61,61,"evidence, of an epileptic subject.",0.0
62,62,His face was decidedly a pleasant,0.5542

65,65,He held a,0.0
66,66,bundle made up of an old faded silk handkerchief that apparently,0.0

69,69,"His black-haired neighbour inspected these peculiarities, having",0.0258

85,85,The conversation proceeded.,0.0
86,86,The readiness of the fair-haired young man,0.25

90,90,inappropriateness in the fact of such questions being put to him.,0.0
91,91,"Replying to them, he made known to the inquirer that he certainly had",0.34

9499,9499,The,0.0
9500,9500,estate was considerably encumbered with debts; creditors turned up on,0.0
9501,9501,"all sides, and the prince, in spite of all advice and entreaty,",-0.5267
9502,9502,"insisted upon managing all matters of claim himself—which, of course,",0.0258

9514,9514,affectionate towards Aglaya was a self-evident fact.,0.4404

9543,9543,"for enjoyment,” of course.",0.0
